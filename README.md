Christmas Gift: Decide to buy a gift for you or another person


This class can be used to decide whether you should buy a gift for you or another person.

It implements an algorithm for asking questions to make a decision.

Depending on the answers, the class shows a link to jump to another step asking another question until it reaches a point of decision on whether to buy a gift or not.

Xmas Gift is a curious script written in PHP that evaluates a user's decision on whether to buy a gift for Christmas or not.

The Script asks the user questions, it is very fast since the way in which the data is loaded is by reading a file with the questions and answers as constants in PHP.

It uses the GET method to send the user's response.

The code is only presented as something functional and demonstrative of an idea about handling the data to execute simple user actions and the responses returned.
